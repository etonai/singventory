# Singventory

**A Karaoke Performance Tracking App for Android**

Singventory is an Android application designed to help karaoke enthusiasts track their song performances across different venues. Keep detailed records of your favorite songs and optimize your karaoke experience with personalized key adjustments that you'll never forget.

> **Development Note**: This app was developed using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) by an experience software developer with no Android development experience prior to July 2025. Claude Code's AI-assisted development capabilities made it possible to create a fully functional Android app.

## üé§ What is Singventory?

Singventory helps you maintain an inventory of songs you like to sing at various karaoke venues. Each venue may have different versions of songs with different keys, song codes, and audio quality. This app helps you track all these venue-specific details so you can have the best possible karaoke experience every time.

## üìä Data Model Overview

### Core Entities
- **Song**: Name, artist, keys, lyrics, performance statistics
- **Venue**: Name, address, details, visit statistics  
- **Visit**: Date/time, venue, notes, spending
- **Performance**: Song performed, key adjustment, notes, timestamp
- **SongVenueInfo**: Venue-specific song data (codes, keys, adjustments)

### Key Relationships
- Songs can be associated with multiple venues (many-to-many)
- Visits belong to one venue and contain multiple performances
- Performances link songs to specific visits
- Statistics are maintained at song, venue, and song-venue levels

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Offline-First
Singventory is designed for use in karaoke venues where internet connectivity may be poor or unreliable. All core features work completely offline, with optional data backup through JSON export.

### Performance-Focused
The app prioritizes quick data entry during live karaoke sessions. Performance logging is optimized for speed and minimal taps while maintaining comprehensive data capture.

### Memory-Friendly
Never forget your key adjustments again! Store your optimal settings on your personal device so you don't have to remember whether "Yesterday" sounds better 2 steps up or 3 steps down at different venues. Key management features support both absolute key selection and relative step adjustments to match how musicians think about transposition.

### Data Preservation
The purging system is designed to remove bulk data (detailed visit records) while preserving essential statistics, ensuring long-term usage doesn't lose valuable performance insights.
