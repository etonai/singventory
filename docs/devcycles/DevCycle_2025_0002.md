# Development Cycle 2025-0002

**Status:** Completed  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Target Completion:** 2025-08-06  
**Focus:** Core database architecture and data model implementation for Singventory

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on implementing the foundational database layer for Singventory, including all entity relationships, Room database setup, and basic CRUD operations. The goal is to establish the data persistence foundation that supports all the complex relationships between songs, venues, visits, and performances identified in the design phase.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1 - Database Entities and Room Setup
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Implement Room database entities, DAOs, and database configuration following PlayStreak's proven MVVM + Repository pattern

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Database Setup:**
- ✅ Create Song entity with all required fields and relationships
- ✅ Create Venue entity with venue-specific data fields
- ✅ Create Visit entity linked to venues with timestamp tracking
- ✅ Create Performance entity linking visits, songs with key adjustments
- ✅ Create SongVenueInfo junction table for venue-specific song data
- ✅ Implement Room database configuration and version management
- ✅ Create DAO interfaces for all entities with required queries

#### Technical Implementation Details
**Complete Database Layer Implemented:**
- **Song Entity**: All fields including totalPerformances and lastPerformed for stats preservation
- **Venue Entity**: Complete venue data with totalVisits and lastVisited tracking
- **Visit Entity**: Full visit lifecycle with isActive flag and end/reopen capability
- **Performance Entity**: Links visits to songs with keyAdjustment for musical key handling
- **SongVenueInfo Entity**: Junction table with venue-specific song data and performance counts
- **MusicalKey Enum**: Complete chromatic scale with key adjustment calculations and transposition
- **Room Database**: Version 1 with all entities, DAOs, and proper foreign key relationships
- **5 DAO Interfaces**: Comprehensive query methods supporting all user scenarios

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Foreign key relationships with CASCADE deletes for data integrity
- Performance count tracking at both global and venue-specific levels
- Support for explicit visit ending and reopening
- Musical key adjustment calculations (C to F# = +6 steps, etc.)
- Search functionality for songs and venues
- Queries optimized for frequent operations (most performed songs, recent visits)

#### Next Steps
Phase 1 complete - database foundation established for all Singventory features

### Phase 2 - Repository Pattern Implementation  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement single repository pattern following PlayStreak's architecture for unified data access

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Repository:**
- ✅ Create SingventoryRepository following PlayStreak's pattern
- ✅ Implement CRUD operations for all entities
- ✅ Add complex queries for venue-song relationships
- ✅ Implement data consistency logic for cascading updates
- ✅ Add query methods for user scenarios (impromptu visit, recon visit, repeat visit)

#### Technical Implementation Details
**Complete Repository Layer Implemented:**
- **Single Repository Pattern**: Unified access to all DAOs following PlayStreak's architecture
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete for all 5 entities
- **Complex Business Logic**: logPerformance() with automatic stats updates across multiple entities
- **User Scenario Support**: startVisit(), getSongsAvailableAtVenue(), addSongToVenue() for all workflows
- **Data Consistency**: Cascading updates ensure Song.totalPerformances and Venue.totalVisits stay accurate
- **Purge Operations**: purgeOldestVisits() preserves essential stats while removing bulk data
- **Duplicate Detection**: findPotentialDuplicateSongs() for user-controlled merging
- **Visit Management**: Complete visit lifecycle with end/reopen capability

#### Next Steps
Phase 2 complete - repository layer provides all business logic for Singventory features

### Phase 3 - Musical Key Management System
**Status:** ✅ Completed (August 6, 2025 11:50PM)  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement musical key handling unique to Singventory including key adjustments and calculations

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Key Management:**
- ✅ Create MusicalKey enum with semitone calculations
- ✅ Implement key adjustment calculation algorithms
- ✅ Add key validation and normalization utilities
- ✅ Implement dual key input support (dropdowns + step adjustments)

#### Technical Implementation Details
**Complete Musical Key System Implemented:**
- **MusicalKey Enum**: Complete chromatic scale with semitone calculations and transposition
- **Key Calculations**: calculateKeyAdjustment() provides optimal step counts (±6 range)
- **KeyUtils**: Comprehensive parsing, formatting, and validation utilities
- **KeyInputHelper**: Dual input method support for dropdown selection vs step adjustments
- **User Scenario Support**: Specialized helpers for impromptu visits, recon visits, and repeat visits
- **Database Integration**: Seamless conversion to/from SongVenueInfo storage format
- **Input Validation**: Handles various key formats (C#, Db, F#/Gb, etc.)
- **Display Formatting**: User-friendly strings like "Venue: F# → You: D (down 4 steps)"

**Key Features:**
- Auto-calculation of key adjustments based on venue and user preference input
- Support for both absolute key selection and relative step adjustments
- Parsing of user input in multiple formats (text, numeric, symbolic)
- Validation ensures all adjustments stay within musical bounds (±6 semitones)
- Integration with repository layer for consistent data storage

#### Next Steps
Phase 3 complete - musical key management system fully operational

## Cycle Notes
- Following PlayStreak's proven Room + Repository + MVVM architecture
- Database schema supports all complex relationships identified in design
- Essential data preservation logic required for future purge functionality
- Key adjustment system is unique requirement not in PlayStreak

## Future Cycles
- UI layer implementation with ViewModels and Fragments
- Import/Export functionality (copy PlayStreak patterns)
- Settings screen with data counters
- Purge data functionality with stats preservation

## Cycle Completion Summary
*[Added when cycle is completed - awaiting user verification]*
