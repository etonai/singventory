# Development Cycle 2025-0001

**Status:** Completed  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Target Completion:** 2025-08-06  
**Focus:** Initial app design and architecture planning for Singventory

## Overview
This is the first development cycle for Singventory, focused on establishing the core app design, user interface concepts, and overall architecture. The goal is to create a solid foundation for the inventory management application.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1 - Design Singventory
**Status:** ✅ Completed (August 6, 2025 11:25PM)  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Design the core user interface, user experience flow, and visual identity for the Singventory inventory management app

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Design:**
- ✅ Define app purpose and target user persona
- ✅ Create wireframes for main screens (conceptual via user scenarios)
- ✅ Design user flow and navigation structure
- ✅ Establish visual design system (Material Design 3 with music theming)
- ✅ Plan data models and storage architecture
- ✅ Define core features and functionality scope

#### Technical Implementation Details
**Complete Design Specification Created:**
- Comprehensive design documented in `docs/Initial_Singventory_Design.md`
- All user workflows defined (impromptu visit, recon visit, repeat visit scenarios)
- Database entity relationships established (Songs, Venues, Visits, Performances, SongVenueInfo)
- UI/UX decisions finalized through Q&A process
- Key management system designed with dual input methods
- Data preservation strategy for purging defined
- PlayStreak architecture patterns identified for reuse

**Key Design Decisions Finalized:**
- Bottom navigation: Songs, Venues, Visits, Stats, Settings
- Search prioritizes frequently performed songs
- Both key dropdown and step adjustment input methods
- Complete stats preservation during data purging
- Auto-calculation of key adjustments with manual override
- Explicit visit end/reopen workflow
- User-controlled duplicate song merging

#### Next Steps
Phase 1 complete - ready for Phase 2 implementation planning

### Phase 2 - Add License
**Status:** ✅ Completed (August 6, 2025 11:25PM)  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Add appropriate license file to establish legal framework for the Singventory project

#### Phase Progress
**Phase License:**
- ✅ Create LICENSE file with all rights reserved
- ✅ Add copyright notice with current year and owner
- ✅ Verify license placement in project root

#### Technical Implementation Details
**License Implementation Completed:**
- Created `LICENSE` file in project root directory
- Established "All Rights Reserved" licensing with Ed Rutherberg as copyright holder
- Added comprehensive copyright notice with 2025 date
- Included standard disclaimer of warranties
- License properly restricts usage, copying, modification, and distribution

#### Next Steps
Phase 2 complete - license framework established
