#### Problem Analysis

**Bug Description:**
When associating a song with a venue, the system incorrectly populates the "Venue key" field with the song's preferred key instead of the reference key, causing confusion in venue-specific key management.

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Venue Key Field**: Should be populated with the song's **reference key** (the original key of the song)
- **Key Adjustment**: Should be calculated as the difference needed to reach the preferred key for that venue
- **Workflow**: Reference key → Key adjustment → Preferred performance key

**Current (Incorrect) Behavior:**
- **Venue Key Field**: Being populated with the song's **preferred key**
- **Impact**: Makes key adjustment calculations confusing and incorrect
- **User Confusion**: Venue key field doesn't represent the actual key the song is written in

#### Technical Investigation Areas

**Song-Venue Association Code:**
- Locate the code responsible for creating new song-venue associations
- Identify where the venue key field is populated during association
- Check AssociateVenuesWithSongFragment and related ViewModels
- Review SongVenueInfo entity and its creation/update logic

**Key Management Logic:**
- Analyze how reference key vs preferred key are handled
- Review key field mappings in song-venue association workflow
- Check if the bug is in creation, update, or display logic
- Identify any recent changes that might have introduced this bug

**Data Model Analysis:**
- Review SongVenueInfo entity structure and key field definitions
- Check if field names are causing confusion (e.g., field named incorrectly)
- Analyze Song entity key fields (referenceKey vs preferredKey)
- Verify database schema and field mappings

#### Expected Changes

**Key Field Assignment Fix:**
```kotlin
// Current (incorrect) - using preferred key
songVenueInfo.venueKey = song.preferredKey

// Fixed (correct) - using reference key  
songVenueInfo.venueKey = song.referenceKey
```

**Association Logic Correction:**
- Ensure new SongVenueInfo records use song.referenceKey for venue key field
- Verify key adjustment calculations work correctly with reference key
- Update any related UI that displays or edits venue key information
- Fix any confusion between reference/preferred key terminology

#### User Experience Impact

**Before Fix (Incorrect):**
- User sees preferred key in venue key field
- Key adjustments don't make logical sense
- Confusion about what key the song is actually in
- Difficulty understanding venue-specific key management

**After Fix (Correct):**
- User sees reference key (original song key) in venue key field  
- Key adjustments clearly show modification from original key
- Logical progression: Reference Key → Adjustment → Preferred Key
- Clear understanding of song's original key vs venue-specific preference

#### Implementation Requirements

**Code Location Investigation:**
1. Find song-venue association creation code
2. Locate SongVenueInfo entity initialization
3. Check AssociateVenuesWithSongFragment logic
4. Review any ViewModels handling song-venue relationships

**Fix Implementation:**
1. Update venue key field assignment to use reference key
2. Verify key adjustment calculations remain correct
3. Test with songs that have both reference and preferred keys
4. Ensure existing associations continue to work properly

**Testing Scenarios:**
1. **Song with both keys**: Reference key = C, Preferred key = D
   - Expected: Venue key shows C, not D
2. **Song with reference key only**: Reference key = G, Preferred key = null
   - Expected: Venue key shows G
3. **Song with preferred key only**: Reference key = null, Preferred key = A
   - Expected: Handle gracefully, possibly show A or empty
4. **Existing associations**: Should not be affected by the fix

#### Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
- New song-venue associations populate venue key field with reference key
- Key adjustment calculations work correctly with reference key
- Existing song-venue associations remain unaffected
- No regression in related key management functionality

**User Experience Requirements:**
- Venue key field clearly shows the original key of the song
- Key adjustments make logical sense (reference → adjustment → preferred)
- Consistent key terminology throughout the application
- No confusion between reference and preferred key concepts

**Quality Standards:**
- No compilation errors or build issues
- All existing functionality continues to work
- Comprehensive testing covers various key configuration scenarios
- Bug fix doesn't introduce new issues in key management

#### Testing Strategy

**Key Configuration Testing:**
- Test songs with both reference and preferred keys set
- Test songs with only reference key set
- Test songs with only preferred key set
- Test songs with no keys set (edge case)

**Association Workflow Testing:**
- Test associating songs with venues through different UI paths
- Verify venue key field population in various scenarios
- Test key adjustment calculations after the fix
- Ensure edit functionality works correctly with fixed venue keys

**Regression Testing:**
- Test existing song-venue associations remain unchanged
