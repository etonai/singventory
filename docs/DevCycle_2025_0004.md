# Development Cycle 2025-0004

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-07  
**Target Completion:** TBD  
**Focus:** Advanced UI features and relationship management for enhanced karaoke session workflows

## Overview
This development cycle builds upon the solid foundation established in DevCycle 3, focusing on advanced user interface features that enhance the karaoke experience. The primary goal is to implement the deferred Song-Venue Association screens and add comprehensive edit/update capabilities that were identified as high-priority missing features. Additionally, this cycle will enhance search/filtering capabilities and complete the Settings screen with full data management functionality following PlayStreak patterns.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1 - Song-Venue Association Screens
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement the deferred advanced relationship management screens for associating songs with venues, enabling comprehensive venue-specific song catalog tracking

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Song-Venue Association Implementation:**
- ❌ TODO: Create AssociateSongsWithVenueFragment for venue-to-songs workflow
- ❌ TODO: Create AssociateVenuesWithSongFragment for song-to-venues workflow  
- ❌ TODO: Implement SongVenueInfo entity relationship management with venue-specific song IDs
- ❌ TODO: Add search and filter functionality for large song/venue lists during association
- ❌ TODO: Create autocomplete and batch operation support for efficient association management
- ❌ TODO: Connect existing "Add venue" and "Add song" buttons in adapters to navigation actions
- ❌ TODO: Implement venue song ID input and key information during association

#### Technical Requirements from Deferred Features
**Core Association Workflows:**
- **Venue-to-Songs Association**: User selects venue, sees available songs to associate, can batch-select multiple songs
- **Song-to-Venues Association**: User selects song, sees available venues to associate, can add venue-specific information
- **SongVenueInfo Management**: Create/update venue-specific song catalogs with venue song IDs and key information
- **Search Integration**: Efficient search/filter for large collections during association process

**UI Components Needed:**
- **Multi-select RecyclerView**: Allow batch selection of songs/venues during association
- **Association Detail Form**: Input venue song ID, key information, and notes for each association
- **Search/Filter Integration**: Reuse existing search patterns but optimize for association workflows
- **Progress Indicators**: Show association progress for batch operations

**Database Integration:**
- **SongVenueInfo CRUD**: Full create, read, update, delete operations for song-venue relationships
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimize queries for "songs not yet associated with venue X" and vice versa
- **Transaction Management**: Ensure atomic operations for batch associations

#### User Scenarios Addressed
**Enhanced Impromptu Visit Support:**
- User discovers new songs at venue and can quickly associate them with existing song entries
- Venue song ID entry enables future quick lookup during return visits

**Advanced Recon Visit Workflow:**
- Pre-visit venue setup can include bulk song association from research
- Venue-specific song catalog preparation before visiting unknown venues

**Repeat Visit Optimization:**
- Complete venue song catalogs enable efficient song selection during visits
- Venue song ID display eliminates manual catalog searching

### Phase 2 - Edit/Update CRUD Operations
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement comprehensive edit and update functionality for Songs and Venues to enable data correction and enhancement

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Edit Operations Implementation:**
- ❌ TODO: Create EditSongFragment with full song information editing
- ❌ TODO: Create EditVenueFragment with complete venue information updates
- ❌ TODO: Implement EditSongViewModel with form validation and data persistence
- ❌ TODO: Implement EditVenueViewModel with venue update logic
- ❌ TODO: Add edit navigation actions from Songs and Venues list items
- ❌ TODO: Create confirmation dialogs for destructive edit operations
- ❌ TODO: Implement song/venue deletion functionality with cascade handling

#### Technical Requirements
**Edit Song Functionality:**
- **Full Song Information**: Edit name, artist, reference key, preferred key, lyrics
- **Performance History Preservation**: Maintain performance statistics during song updates
- **Venue Association Updates**: Handle song name changes across all venue associations
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Prevent invalid data entry and handle conflicts

**Edit Venue Functionality:**
- **Complete Venue Information**: Edit name, address, cost, room type, hours, notes
- **Visit History Preservation**: Maintain visit statistics during venue updates
- **Song Association Updates**: Handle venue name changes across all song associations
- **Location and Contact Updates**: Support address and operational information changes

**Data Integrity Considerations:**
- **Relationship Preservation**: Ensure edit operations don't break song-venue-visit relationships
- **Statistics Recalculation**: Update calculated fields when core data changes
- **Cascade Operations**: Handle deletion with proper cleanup of dependent records

### Phase 3 - Enhanced Search and Filtering
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** Medium-High  
**Description:** Implement advanced search and filtering capabilities to improve user experience with large song/venue collections

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Search Enhancement Implementation:**
- ❌ TODO: Implement advanced song search with multiple criteria (title, artist, key, venue availability)
- ❌ TODO: Create venue search with location and feature-based filtering
- ❌ TODO: Add performance-based filtering (frequently performed, recently performed, never performed)
- ❌ TODO: Implement search result prioritization based on user activity patterns
- ❌ TODO: Create saved search/filter presets for common user queries
- ❌ TODO: Add quick filter buttons for common search scenarios

#### Technical Requirements
**Multi-Criteria Song Search:**
- **Text Search**: Song name, artist name with partial matching and fuzzy search
- **Musical Key Filtering**: Search by reference key, preferred key, or key range
- **Venue Availability**: Filter songs by venue association ("available at RockBox", "not available anywhere")
- **Performance History**: Filter by performance frequency, last performed date, never performed

**Advanced Venue Filtering:**
- **Location-Based**: Search by address, city, or proximity (future GPS enhancement)
- **Feature-Based**: Filter by room type (private/public), cost range, operating hours
- **Visit History**: Filter by visit frequency, last visited, never visited

**Search Performance Optimization:**
- **Database Indexing**: Ensure efficient queries for multi-criteria searches
- **Result Caching**: Cache common search results for improved performance
- **Incremental Search**: Provide real-time search suggestions as user types

### Phase 4 - Settings Screen Enhancements  
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Complete the Settings screen with comprehensive data management functionality following PlayStreak patterns

#### Phase Progress
