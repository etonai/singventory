- ✅ COMPLETED: Fix bottom navigation item selection state management for all subpage hierarchies
- ✅ COMPLETED: Test navigation flows for all main sections and their subpages
- ✅ COMPLETED: Ensure consistent highlighting behavior across entire navigation hierarchy

#### Technical Investigation Areas
**Navigation Graph Analysis:**
- Review nav_graph.xml structure for all main navigation sections and their subpages
- Identify subpages for each main section:
  - **Songs**: Add Song, Edit Song, Song Details, Song-Venue Associations
  - **Venues**: Add Venue, Edit Venue, Venue Details, Venue Songs
  - **Visits**: Start Visit, Visit Details, Performance Edit, Add Performance
  - **Settings**: Import/Export, Purge Data, Configuration
- Verify navigation action definitions and destination relationships
- Examine fragment-to-bottom-navigation-item mapping for all destinations

**Bottom Navigation Setup:**
- Investigate MainActivity's bottom navigation configuration
- Check if NavigationUI.setupWithNavController is properly configured
- Verify bottom navigation menu XML matches navigation graph destinations
- Examine any custom navigation handling that might override automatic behavior

**Fragment Lifecycle Integration:**
- Check if fragments properly report their navigation context
- Verify if fragment lifecycle methods interfere with navigation highlighting
- Examine any manual navigation state management in fragments
- Test if issue occurs consistently across all nested destinations

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Potential Issues:**
1. **Navigation Graph Structure**: Subpages may not be properly nested under parent destinations
2. **Bottom Navigation Mapping**: Menu items may not correctly map to navigation destinations  
3. **Navigation Component Configuration**: Automatic highlighting may be misconfigured
4. **Fragment Association**: Fragments may not properly associate with parent tabs
5. **State Management**: Manual navigation state changes may override automatic behavior

**User Workflows Affected:**
- **Visits**: Visit tab → Start Visit → Other tab → Return to Visit → Wrong highlighting
- **Songs**: Songs tab → Add Song → Other tab → Return to Songs → Wrong highlighting  
- **Venues**: Venues tab → Edit Venue → Other tab → Return to Venues → Wrong highlighting
- **Settings**: Settings tab → Configuration → Other tab → Return to Settings → Wrong highlighting

#### Expected Behavior After Fix
**Correct Navigation Highlighting:**
- **Songs subpages**: Add Song, Edit Song, etc. should highlight Songs tab
- **Venues subpages**: Add Venue, Edit Venue, Venue Details, etc. should highlight Venues tab
- **Visits subpages**: Start Visit, Visit Details, Performance Edit, etc. should highlight Visits tab
- **Settings subpages**: Import/Export, Purge Data, Configuration should highlight Settings tab
