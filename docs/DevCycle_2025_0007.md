### Phase 10 - Research Key Adjustment Data Model: Unknown vs Zero Adjustment
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** High  
**Build Version:** 0.0.4  
**Description:** Research and planning phase to design data model solution for distinguishing between songs with confirmed zero key adjustment versus songs with unknown/unset key adjustment status

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 10 Key Adjustment Data Research and Planning:**
- ❌ TODO: Analyze current key adjustment data model and database schema
- ❌ TODO: Research user workflows for key adjustment discovery and confirmation
- ❌ TODO: Design data model to distinguish unknown vs confirmed zero adjustments
- ❌ TODO: Plan UI/UX patterns for key adjustment status indication and management
- ❌ TODO: Evaluate database migration strategy for existing key adjustment data
- ❌ TODO: Research best practices for nullable vs status enum approaches
- ❌ TODO: Design user interaction patterns for key adjustment confirmation workflows

#### Problem Analysis
**Current Data Ambiguity:**
Currently, a song-venue key adjustment of `0` could mean two fundamentally different things:
1. **Confirmed Zero Adjustment**: User has determined that no key change is needed (song works perfectly in original key at this venue)
2. **Unknown Adjustment**: User hasn't yet determined what key adjustment (if any) is needed for this song at this venue

**Business Impact:**
- **User Confusion**: Cannot distinguish between "tested and confirmed no adjustment needed" vs "haven't figured out the adjustment yet"
- **Data Reliability**: Key adjustment recommendations become unreliable without confidence indicators
- **User Experience**: Users may re-test songs they've already confirmed work in original key
- **Performance Tracking**: Cannot track which songs still need key adjustment discovery vs confirmed settings

#### Research Areas
**Data Model Options:**
1. **Nullable Key Adjustment**: Allow NULL values to indicate unknown, 0 for confirmed zero adjustment
2. **Status Enum Approach**: Add key adjustment status field (UNKNOWN, CONFIRMED, NEEDS_TESTING)
3. **Confidence Level**: Numeric confidence indicator for key adjustment accuracy
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Track when key adjustment was last confirmed or updated
5. **User Intent Flags**: Separate flags for "user has tested" vs "user confirmed setting"

**User Workflow Analysis:**
- **Initial Association**: Song first associated with venue (unknown key adjustment)
- **First Performance**: User discovers key adjustment needed during performance
- **Confirmation**: User confirms key adjustment works well through repeated performances
- **Revision**: User updates key adjustment based on new information or preferences
- **Venue Variability**: Different venues may require different adjustments for same song

**UI/UX Design Considerations:**
- **Visual Indicators**: How to show unknown vs confirmed key adjustments in lists
- **Confirmation Workflows**: User actions to confirm key adjustment accuracy
- **Bulk Operations**: Managing key adjustment status for multiple songs
- **Performance Integration**: Updating key adjustment confidence during performance logging
- **Search and Filtering**: Finding songs with unknown vs confirmed key adjustments

#### Technical Research
**Database Schema Implications:**
- **Migration Strategy**: How to handle existing song-venue key adjustment data
- **Query Performance**: Impact of additional fields on key adjustment queries
- **Index Optimization**: Optimal indexing for key adjustment status queries
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring key adjustment status remains consistent with actual values
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Impact on performance and song-venue relationship queries

**Application Architecture:**
- **Data Layer**: DAO and entity changes needed for key adjustment status
- **Business Logic**: Service layer handling of key adjustment confirmation workflows
- **UI Layer**: Fragment and adapter changes for status display and management
- **Performance Integration**: How performance logging affects key adjustment confidence

**State Management:**
- **Default States**: What should be the default state for new song-venue associations
- **State Transitions**: Valid transitions between unknown, confirmed, and revision states
- **Validation Rules**: Business rules for key adjustment status changes
- **Undo/Redo**: Handling user mistakes in key adjustment confirmation

#### Research Methodology
**Current System Analysis:**
- Review existing key adjustment storage and calculation logic
- Analyze user behavior patterns in key adjustment usage
- Identify pain points in current key adjustment workflow
- Document edge cases and user confusion scenarios

**User Story Development:**
- **As a user**, I want to know which songs I've confirmed work in original key at a venue
- **As a user**, I want to identify songs that still need key adjustment discovery
- **As a user**, I want to track my confidence in key adjustment accuracy over time
- **As a user**, I want to avoid re-testing songs I've already confirmed

**Technical Feasibility Study:**
- Evaluate database migration complexity and data preservation
- Assess UI/UX changes needed for key adjustment status management
- Analyze performance impact of additional key adjustment metadata
- Research similar problems and solutions in other applications

#### Proposed Solutions for Evaluation
**Option A: Nullable Key Adjustment with Confirmation Flag**
```sql
-- Add confirmation status to song_venue_info table
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
-- NULL key_adjustment = unknown, 0 with confirmed=true = confirmed zero
```

**Option B: Key Adjustment Status Enum**
```sql
-- Add status enum field
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_status TEXT CHECK (key_adjustment_status IN ('UNKNOWN', 'DISCOVERED', 'CONFIRMED', 'NEEDS_REVISION'));
```

**Option C: Confidence-Based Approach**
```sql
-- Add confidence level and last updated tracking
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_confidence INTEGER DEFAULT 0; -- 0-100 scale
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_updated_at TIMESTAMP;
```

#### Expected Research Outcomes
