# Development Cycle 2025-0007

**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Start Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Target Completion:** TBD  
**Focus:** Test Build Version 0.0.2 and Enhancement Implementation - comprehensive testing and feature development

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on thorough testing of Singventory build version 0.0.2 to identify any issues, bugs, or areas for improvement following the successful bug fixes and enhancements completed in DevCycle 6. Based on the testing results from Phase 1, subsequent phases will address discovered bugs and implement additional features to enhance the user experience.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1 - Test Build 0.0.2 Comprehensive Testing
**Status:** ❌ TODO

- ❌ TODO: Test core song management functionality (add, edit, delete, search)
- ❌ TODO: Test venue management functionality (add, edit, delete, venue details)
- ❌ TODO: Test visit creation and management workflows
- ❌ TODO: Test performance logging and editing capabilities
- ❌ TODO: Verify smart song-venue association pre-population (Phase 7 from DevCycle 6)
- ❌ TODO: Verify consistent screen title branding (Phase 8 from DevCycle 6)
- ❌ TODO: Test performance deletion fix (Phase 4 from DevCycle 6)
- ❌ TODO: Test visit performance count accuracy (Phase 5 from DevCycle 6)
- ❌ TODO: Test visit deletion statistics consistency (Phase 6 from DevCycle 6)
- ❌ TODO: Test key adjustment calculations and display
- ❌ TODO: Test data consistency across all entity relationships
- ❌ TODO: Test app navigation and bottom navigation highlighting
- ❌ TODO: Test settings screen and data overview functionality
- ❌ TODO: Test edge cases and error handling scenarios
- ❌ TODO: Document all discovered bugs and issues for subsequent phases
- ❌ TODO: Document potential feature enhancements based on user experience testing

#### Technical Testing Areas
**Core Functionality Verification:**
- Song CRUD operations with proper validation
- Venue CRUD operations and address handling
- Visit lifecycle management (start, add performances, end visit)
- Performance logging with key adjustments and notes
- Song-venue association management and pre-population logic

**Bug Fix Verification:**
- Performance deletion now properly handles async operations and navigation
- Visit performance counts display accurate numbers from database joins
- Visit deletion properly updates all related statistics and maintains consistency
- Smart association pre-population works correctly when songs have key information
- Screen titles consistently show "Singventory" branding across all main sections

**Data Integrity Testing:**
- Statistics consistency across songs, venues, and performances
- Foreign key constraint handling during deletions
- Cascade deletion behavior for visits and performances
- Performance count accuracy in all display contexts
- Last performed date calculations and updates

**User Interface Testing:**
- Bottom navigation functionality and highlighting
- Form validation and error message display
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Key adjustment input methods and calculations
- Navigation flow between screens and proper back navigation

**Edge Case Scenarios:**
- Empty database state handling
- Large dataset performance (approaching 500 visit limit)
- Concurrent data operations and state management
- App lifecycle handling (pause, resume, orientation changes)
- Invalid input handling and user feedback

#### User Workflow Testing
**Complete User Scenarios:**
1. **New User Setup**: First-time app use with empty database
2. **Song Discovery**: Adding new songs and associating with venues
3. **Venue Exploration**: Adding venues and building song catalogs
4. **Live Karaoke Session**: Creating visits and logging performances in real-time
5. **Data Review**: Reviewing performance history and statistics
6. **Data Management**: Editing songs, venues, and performance details
7. **Statistics Verification**: Ensuring counts and dates remain accurate

#### Next Steps
**Phase 1 Completion Criteria:**
- All testing scenarios completed successfully
- All bugs documented with reproduction steps and severity assessment
- Feature enhancement opportunities identified and prioritized
- Version 0.0.2 stability and functionality verified
- Clear requirements established for subsequent development phases
