# Development Cycle 2025-0005

**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Start Date:** TBD  
**Target Completion:** TBD  
**Focus:** Core Karaoke Session Management - implementing fundamental visit and performance logging system

## Overview

This development cycle addresses the critical gap in Singventory's functionality by implementing the core visit management and performance logging system. While DevCycle 4 successfully established comprehensive song/venue database management with associations and settings, users currently cannot perform the primary function of the app: tracking karaoke sessions. This cycle enables users to start visits, log performances during sessions, and manage their karaoke activity - the fundamental purpose of Singventory as described in the Initial Design document.
