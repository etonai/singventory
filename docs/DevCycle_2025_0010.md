### Phase 2 - Fix Venue Songs Visit Context Bug and + Icon Functionality
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High  
**Build Version:** 0.0.9  
**Description:** Fix critical bug where Venue Songs page incorrectly uses active visit context instead of the specific visit that navigated to it, causing performance logging to go to wrong visit. Additionally, ensure + icons are properly enabled when navigating from visit context to allow performance logging to the correct visit.

#### Problem Analysis
**Bug Description:**
When navigating to Venue Songs from an old/completed visit, the page incorrectly detects and uses the active visit context instead of maintaining the originating visit context. This causes:
- Active Visit indicator shows when it shouldn't (for old visits)
- Performance logging goes to the active visit instead of the intended visit
- User confusion when trying to add performances to historical visits

**+ Icon Functionality Issue:**
Additionally, when navigating from visit context, the + icons should be enabled for active visits to allow performance logging to the correct visit, but disabled for completed visits to prevent incorrect performance logging.

**Root Cause:**
The Venue Songs page only receives `venueId` parameter and then automatically detects any active visit for that venue, ignoring the specific visit context that triggered the navigation.

#### Technical Investigation Areas

**Navigation Context Preservation:**
- Add `visitId` parameter to Venue Songs navigation actions
- Update Visit Details and Visits page navigation to pass specific visit ID
- Modify Venue Songs Fragment to accept and use the provided visit context

**Active Visit Logic Updates:**
- Distinguish between "venue has active visit" vs "this specific visit is active"
- Show active visit indicator only when navigating from current active visit
- Use provided visit ID for performance logging instead of auto-detecting active visit

**UI State Management:**
- Update active visit indicator visibility logic
- Ensure performance logging uses correct visit context
- Maintain backward compatibility for venue-only navigation (from Venues page)

#### Expected Outcomes

**Correct Visit Context:**
- Performance logging goes to the intended visit, not the active visit
- Active visit indicator only shows when appropriate
- Historical visit performance addition works correctly

**+ Icon Functionality:**
- + icons show for ANY visit (active or completed) when navigating from visit context
- + icons hidden only when navigating from Venues page with no active visit
- Performance logging through + icons goes to the correct visit (active or historical)
- Users can add performances to both current and historical visits

**User Experience Improvement:**
- Users can reliably add performances to any visit when in visit context
- Clear visual indication of which visit context they're working in
- No confusion between active visit and selected visit contexts
- Intuitive + icon behavior: visible for any visit context, hidden when no visit context
- Support for historical performance logging to completed visits

#### Implementation Requirements

**Navigation Updates:**
- Modify `action_visits_to_venueSongs` to include `visitId` parameter
- Modify `action_visitDetails_to_venueSongs` to include `visitId` parameter
- Update Fragment argument handling to accept optional `visitId`

**Logic Updates:**
- Use provided `visitId` for performance logging when available
- Fall back to active visit detection only when no `visitId` provided
- Update active visit indicator display logic

#### Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
- Performance logging goes to correct visit when navigated from specific visit
- Active visit indicator only shows for actual active visit context
- + icons only visible when there's a valid visit context for performance logging
- No regressions in existing venue-only navigation flows

**User Experience Requirements:**
- Clear and predictable behavior when adding performances to historical visits
- Consistent visual indicators matching the actual visit context
- Reliable performance logging to intended visit

#### Next Steps

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Update navigation graph with visitId parameters
- Modify fragment navigation calls to pass visitId
- Update VenueSongsFragment to handle visit-specific context
- Update VenueSongsViewModel to use provided visit context
- Test all navigation scenarios to ensure correct behavior

### Phase 3 - Fix Bottom Navigation Home Navigation
**Status:** ‚ùå TODO  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Build Version:** 0.0.9  
**Description:** Ensure bottom navigation icons always navigate to the main/home page for each section, providing consistent navigation behavior regardless of current page depth

#### Problem Analysis
**User Experience Issue:**
Currently, pressing bottom navigation icons may not consistently take users to the main page of each section. Users expect bottom navigation to provide a reliable way to return to the primary page for Songs, Venues, Visits, and Settings sections, regardless of how deep they are in the navigation stack.

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Songs icon**: Always navigate to main Songs page (SongsFragment)
- **Venues icon**: Always navigate to main Venues page (VenuesFragment)  
- **Visits icon**: Always navigate to main Visits page (VisitsFragment)
- **Settings icon**: Always navigate to main Settings page (SettingsFragment)

#### Technical Investigation Areas

**Bottom Navigation Implementation:**
- Review current bottom navigation configuration in MainActivity
- Analyze how navigation destinations are currently handled
- Identify any inconsistencies in navigation behavior

**Navigation Stack Management:**
- Ensure bottom navigation clears stack to destination root
- Implement proper back stack management for main sections
- Handle deep-linking scenarios appropriately

**User Experience Consistency:**
- Provide predictable navigation behavior across all sections
- Ensure users can always "get home" using bottom navigation
- Maintain navigation state appropriately

#### Expected Outcomes

**Consistent Navigation Behavior:**
- Bottom navigation icons reliably navigate to main section pages
- Users can easily return to primary pages from any depth
- Predictable and intuitive navigation experience

**Improved User Experience:**
- Reduced navigation confusion when exploring deep in sections
- Reliable "home" button functionality for each major section
- Consistent behavior matching standard mobile app patterns

#### Implementation Requirements

**Navigation Configuration:**
- Update MainActivity bottom navigation handling
- Configure navigation component to pop to section roots
- Ensure proper fragment replacement vs. addition behavior

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test navigation from various depths in each section
- Verify back stack behavior after bottom navigation usage
- Ensure no navigation loops or unexpected behavior

#### Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
- Bottom navigation icons consistently navigate to main section pages
- Proper back stack management maintains expected navigation flow
- No regression in existing navigation functionality

**User Experience Requirements:**
- Intuitive and predictable navigation behavior
- Users can reliably navigate to main pages from anywhere
- Consistent behavior across all four main sections

#### Next Steps

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Review and update MainActivity bottom navigation logic
- Configure Navigation Component for proper section root navigation
- Test navigation behavior from various application states
- Ensure consistent behavior across all main sections
- Validate back navigation works correctly after bottom nav usage

## Future Phases

Based on testing results from Phase 1, subsequent phases will be added to implement:
- Unit test configuration fix (identified in Phase 1)
- Additional feature enhancements identified through user experience evaluation
- Performance optimizations based on testing observations
- Additional workflow improvements suggested by testing feedback

## Implementation Notes

This DevCycle follows the discovery-driven approach where Phase 1 testing will identify the specific work items for subsequent phases. The cycle is designed to be responsive to actual testing results rather than pre-planned features, ensuring that the most important issues discovered during testing receive immediate attention.
