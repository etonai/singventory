**Data Mapping Problems:**
- Visit adapter displaying wrong field for performance count
- Repository not providing performance count data
- ViewModel not exposing correct performance count information

#### Next Steps
[Implementation pending user authorization]

### Phase 6 - Visit Deletion Statistics Update Bug Fix
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Fix statistics not updating when visits are deleted - visit counts and song performance counts should decrease when a visit and its performances are deleted

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 6 Visit Deletion Statistics Bug Fix Implementation:**
- ❌ TODO: Investigate visit deletion workflow in VisitsFragment/VisitsAdapter
- ❌ TODO: Verify if visit deletion includes cascading performance deletion
- ❌ TODO: Check if deleteVisit operation updates related statistics counters
- ❌ TODO: Examine venue visit count updates when visit is deleted
- ❌ TODO: Verify song performance count decrements when performances are deleted with visit
- ❌ TODO: Check SongVenueInfo performance count updates during visit deletion
- ❌ TODO: Ensure last performed dates are recalculated after visit deletion
- ❌ TODO: Test visit deletion statistics updates in Settings page data overview
- ❌ TODO: Verify database cascading deletes work correctly for Visit → Performance relationship
- ❌ TODO: Create comprehensive deleteVisitWithStats repository method

#### Technical Investigation Areas
**Visit Deletion Workflow:**
- Verify if deleteVisit() method exists and handles cascading deletions
- Check if visit deletion properly removes associated performances
- Ensure database foreign key constraints handle CASCADE deletes correctly
- Confirm visit deletion updates venue.totalVisits counter

**Performance Deletion Cascading:**
- Investigate if performances are deleted when parent visit is deleted
- Verify performance deletion triggers statistics updates
- Check if song.totalPerformances decrements for each deleted performance
- Ensure SongVenueInfo.performanceCount updates correctly

**Statistics Recalculation:**
- Verify venue statistics update when visit is deleted
- Check if song performance counts decrement appropriately  
- Ensure last performed dates are recalculated if most recent performance deleted
- Confirm Settings page counters reflect accurate data after deletions

**Repository Method Enhancement:**
- Create deleteVisitWithStats() method similar to deletePerformanceWithStats()
- Implement atomic transaction for visit deletion with statistics updates
- Ensure proper error handling during complex deletion operations
- Add logging for debugging statistics update issues

#### User Scenarios Affected
**Visit Management Workflow:**
- User creates visit → adds performance → ends visit → deletes visit → expects all counters to decrease
- User checks Settings page after visit deletion → expects accurate visit/performance counts
- User reviews song statistics → expects performance count to reflect deleted visit performances

**Data Integrity Issues:**
- Statistics become inflated over time if deletions don't update counters
- User loses trust in data accuracy when counts don't match reality
- Settings page data overview shows incorrect totals after deletions

#### Expected Behavior After Fix
**Immediate Statistics Updates:**
- Visit deletion decrements venue.totalVisits by 1
- Each performance in deleted visit decrements song.totalPerformances
- SongVenueInfo.performanceCount decreases for venue-specific performances
- Settings page counters update immediately after visit deletion

**Date Recalculation:**
- If deleted visit contained most recent performance, lastPerformed dates recalculate
- Venue.lastVisited updates to next most recent visit if deleted visit was most recent
- Song performance history remains accurate after visit deletion

#### Likely Implementation Approach
**Enhanced Repository Method:**
```kotlin
suspend fun deleteVisitWithStats(visit: Visit) {
    // 1. Get all performances for this visit
    // 2. Delete visit (cascade deletes performances)
    // 3. Decrement venue.totalVisits
    // 4. For each performance: decrement song.totalPerformances
    // 5. Update SongVenueInfo performance counts
    // 6. Recalculate lastPerformed/lastVisited dates
}
```

**Database Transaction Requirements:**
- All operations must be atomic to prevent data inconsistency
- Proper error handling if any statistics update fails
- Rollback capability if deletion partially completes

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Missing Statistics Updates:**
- Visit deletion likely only removes visit record, not updating counters
- No cascading statistics updates when performances are deleted
- Repository missing deleteVisitWithStats equivalent method

**Database Design Issues:**
- Foreign key constraints may not trigger statistics updates
- Statistics calculation may rely on manual updates rather than triggers
- Missing transaction boundaries for complex deletion operations

#### Next Steps
[Implementation pending user authorization]

### Phase 7 - Smart Song-Venue Association Pre-Population
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Automatically populate venue key and key adjustment fields when associating songs based on song's preferred key information

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 7 Smart Association Pre-Population Implementation:**
- ❌ TODO: Modify AssociationDetailsDialog to accept song's preferred key information
- ❌ TODO: Update AssociationDetailsDialog initialization to auto-populate venue key from song's preferred key
- ❌ TODO: Calculate key adjustment automatically when song has both reference key and preferred key
- ❌ TODO: Implement logic: if song.preferredKey exists, set venue key dropdown to song.preferredKey
- ❌ TODO: Implement logic: if song has both referenceKey and preferredKey, calculate adjustment and pre-fill
- ❌ TODO: Update song association workflows to pass song key information to dialog
- ❌ TODO: Ensure pre-populated values can still be manually overridden by user
- ❌ TODO: Test auto-population with various key scenarios (major/minor, same/different keys)
- ❌ TODO: Verify key adjustment calculation accuracy with new minor key support
- ❌ TODO: Update association creation in SongsFragment, VenuesFragment, and other entry points

#### Technical Implementation Details
**Dialog Enhancement:**
- Modify AssociationDetailsDialog.newInstance() to accept Song object or key information
- Add auto-population logic in setupUI() method before user interaction
- Calculate key adjustment using MusicalKey.calculateKeyAdjustment() when both keys available
- Preserve user's ability to modify pre-populated values

**Key Population Logic:**
```kotlin
// If song has preferred key, use it as default venue key
song.preferredKey?.let { preferredKey ->
    binding.venueKeyDropdown.setText(preferredKey.displayName, false)
}

// If song has both reference and preferred keys, calculate adjustment
if (song.referenceKey != null && song.preferredKey != null) {
    val adjustment = MusicalKey.calculateKeyAdjustment(song.referenceKey, song.preferredKey)
    updateKeyAdjustmentDisplay(adjustment)
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- Update song association creation workflows to pass song information
- Ensure all paths to AssociationDetailsDialog provide song context
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing association editing

#### User Experience Improvements
**Reduced Data Entry:**
- User selects song to associate → venue key automatically filled with song's preferred key
- Key adjustment automatically calculated based on song's key preferences
- User can still override any pre-populated values if venue differs from song preference

**Intelligent Defaults:**
- Song in F# with user preferring D → venue key shows "F#", adjustment shows "-4 steps"
- Song with no key preferences → dialog remains empty as before
- Consistent behavior across all song association entry points

**Enhanced Workflow:**
- Faster song-venue association creation with fewer manual inputs
- Reduced errors from manual key adjustment calculations
- Maintains flexibility for venue-specific overrides

#### User Scenarios Addressed
**Streamlined Association Creation:**
- User knows song "Yesterday" is in F, they prefer singing in D
- When associating with venue, venue key auto-fills to F, adjustment shows "-3 steps"
- User can immediately save or adjust if venue plays it differently

**Key Information Leverage:**
- Previously entered song key preferences automatically applied to new associations
- Reduces repetitive data entry across multiple venue associations
- Maintains data consistency between song preferences and venue associations

**Flexible Override Capability:**
- Some venues may play song in different key than song's default
- User can modify pre-populated venue key if needed
- Key adjustment recalculates automatically when venue key is changed
