# Development Cycle 2025-0006

**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Start Date:** August 9, 2025  
**Target Completion:** TBD  
**Focus:** Test Build Version 0.0.1 and Bug Discovery - comprehensive testing and issue tracking

## Overview

This development cycle focuses on thorough testing of the current Singventory application (version 0.0.1) to identify bugs, issues, and areas for improvement. With DevCycle 5 having completed the core karaoke session management system, this cycle shifts to quality assurance and bug tracking to ensure a stable and reliable user experience.

## Current Work Items

### Test Build 0.0.1 Comprehensive Testing
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Systematically test all functionality implemented in DevCycles 1-5 to identify bugs, edge cases, and usability issues

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 1: Comprehensive Testing:**
- ❌ TODO: Build and verify version 0.0.1 APK
- ❌ TODO: Set up test environment and test data scenarios
- ❌ TODO: Create test user workflows covering all major features
- ❌ TODO: Establish bug tracking and priority classification system
- ❌ TODO: Test song management (add, edit, delete, search)
- ❌ TODO: Test venue management (add, edit, delete, venue songs)
- ❌ TODO: Test visit management (start, active visit, end visit)
- ❌ TODO: Test performance logging (quick log, detailed log, editing)
- ❌ TODO: Test song-venue associations (add, edit, view associations)
- ❌ TODO: Test navigation flows between all screens
- ❌ TODO: Test configurable song selection modes (search vs dropdown)
- ❌ TODO: Test key adjustment displays and controls
- ❌ TODO: Test Material Design 3 theming and responsiveness
- ❌ TODO: Test error handling and edge cases
- ❌ TODO: Test performance statistics accuracy across CRUD operations
- ❌ TODO: Test database relationships and constraints
- ❌ TODO: Test data persistence across app restarts
- ❌ TODO: Test concurrent data operations and race conditions
- ❌ TODO: Test app performance with large datasets
- ❌ TODO: Test memory usage and potential leaks
- ❌ TODO: Test edge cases (empty states, invalid inputs, network issues)
- ❌ TODO: Test accessibility features and compatibility

#### Technical Testing Requirements
**Build Verification:**
- Confirm version 0.0.1 builds successfully for debug and release
- Verify all navigation actions work correctly
- Ensure all database migrations and schemas are valid
- Test APK installation and first-run experience

**Feature Coverage Testing:**
- All screens accessible and functional
- All CRUD operations work as expected
- Statistics calculations are accurate
- Configuration settings persist and apply correctly

**Bug Classification System:**
- **Critical**: App crashes, data loss, core functionality broken
- **High**: Major feature not working, significant UX issues
- **Medium**: Minor feature issues, cosmetic problems
- **Low**: Enhancement opportunities, minor UX improvements

#### Bug Tracking Format
For each discovered bug:
```
**Bug ID:** BUG-YYYY-NNNN
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Component:** [Song Management/Venue Management/Visit Management/Performance Logging/UI/Data]
**Description:** [Clear description of the issue]
**Steps to Reproduce:** [Detailed reproduction steps]
**Expected Behavior:** [What should happen]
**Actual Behavior:** [What actually happens]
**Test Environment:** [Version, device, conditions]
**Status:** [New/In Progress/Fixed/Verified]
```

#### Test Scenarios to Cover
**Happy Path Scenarios:**
- Complete visit workflow from start to performance logging to end
- Song and venue management with associations
- Performance editing and statistics updates

**Edge Case Scenarios:**
- Empty database first-run
- Very long song/venue names
- Invalid input handling
- Concurrent operations
- App backgrounding/foregrounding

**Error Scenarios:**
- Network connectivity issues (if applicable)
- Database corruption recovery
- Invalid data states
- Memory pressure conditions

## Cycle Notes
- This cycle represents a shift from feature development to quality assurance
- Focus on user experience and stability rather than new functionality
- Bug discoveries will inform priorities for future development cycles
- Comprehensive testing approach ensures reliability before potential release

## Future Cycles
Based on bugs discovered in this cycle:
- DevCycle 2025-0007: Critical bug fixes and stability improvements
- DevCycle 2025-0008: UI/UX enhancements and usability improvements
- DevCycle 2025-0009: Performance optimizations and edge case handling
- DevCycle 2025-0010: Feature refinements based on testing insights
