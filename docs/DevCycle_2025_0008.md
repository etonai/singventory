### Phase 2 - Research Key Adjustment Data Model: Unknown vs Zero Adjustment
**Status:** ❌ TODO  
**Priority:** High  
**Build Version:** 0.0.5  
**Description:** Research and planning phase to design data model solution for distinguishing between songs with confirmed zero key adjustment versus songs with unknown/unset key adjustment status

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 2 Key Adjustment Data Research and Planning:**
- ❌ TODO: Analyze current key adjustment data model and database schema
- ❌ TODO: Research user workflows for key adjustment discovery and confirmation
- ❌ TODO: Design data model to distinguish unknown vs confirmed zero adjustments
- ❌ TODO: Plan UI/UX patterns for key adjustment status indication and management
- ❌ TODO: Evaluate database migration strategy for existing key adjustment data
- ❌ TODO: Research best practices for nullable vs status enum approaches
- ❌ TODO: Design user interaction patterns for key adjustment confirmation workflows

#### Problem Analysis
**Current Data Ambiguity:**
Currently, a song-venue key adjustment of `0` could mean two fundamentally different things:
1. **Confirmed Zero Adjustment**: User has determined that no key change is needed (song works perfectly in original key at this venue)
2. **Unknown Adjustment**: User hasn't yet determined what key adjustment (if any) is needed for this song at this venue

**Business Impact:**
- **User Confusion**: Cannot distinguish between "tested and confirmed no adjustment needed" vs "haven't figured out the adjustment yet"
- **Data Reliability**: Key adjustment recommendations become unreliable without confidence indicators
- **User Experience**: Users may re-test songs they've already confirmed work in original key
- **Performance Tracking**: Cannot track which songs still need key adjustment discovery vs confirmed settings

#### Research Areas
**Data Model Options:**
1. **Nullable Key Adjustment**: Allow NULL values to indicate unknown, 0 for confirmed zero adjustment
2. **Status Enum Approach**: Add key adjustment status field (UNKNOWN, CONFIRMED, NEEDS_TESTING)
3. **Confidence Level**: Numeric confidence indicator for key adjustment accuracy
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Track when key adjustment was last confirmed or updated
5. **User Intent Flags**: Separate flags for "user has tested" vs "user confirmed setting"

**User Workflow Analysis:**
- **Initial Association**: Song first associated with venue (unknown key adjustment)
- **First Performance**: User discovers key adjustment needed during performance
- **Confirmation**: User confirms key adjustment works well through repeated performances
- **Revision**: User updates key adjustment based on new information or preferences
- **Venue Variability**: Different venues may require different adjustments for same song

**UI/UX Design Considerations:**
- **Visual Indicators**: How to show unknown vs confirmed key adjustments in lists
- **Confirmation Workflows**: User actions to confirm key adjustment accuracy
- **Discovery Assistance**: Help users identify when key adjustments are needed
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient ways to manage key adjustment status for many songs
- **Performance Integration**: How to update confidence during performance logging

#### Technical Research Areas
**Database Schema Analysis:**
- Review current SongVenueInfo table structure and key adjustment field
- Analyze impact of schema changes on existing data and foreign key relationships
- Research database migration strategies for adding status/confidence fields
- Evaluate performance implications of additional fields and queries

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Option A**: Nullable key adjustment with confirmation boolean flag
- **Option B**: Key adjustment status enum with descriptive states
- **Option C**: Confidence-based system with numeric reliability scores
- **Option D**: Timestamp-based approach tracking last confirmation date

**Implementation Complexity:**
- Database migration requirements and data preservation strategies
- UI changes needed across song management, venue management, and performance logging
- Query optimization for filtering by adjustment confidence/status
- Impact on existing import/export functionality and data consistency

#### User Experience Research
**Current Pain Points:**
- Users cannot distinguish between untested and confirmed zero adjustments
- No clear workflow for key adjustment discovery and confirmation
- Uncertainty about which songs still need key adjustment testing
- Difficulty tracking key adjustment reliability across multiple venues

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Clear visual indicators for adjustment status in all song/venue lists
- Guided workflows for key adjustment discovery during performance logging
- Bulk confirmation tools for managing many song-venue associations
- Status-based filtering and sorting for key adjustment management

**Workflow Integration:**
- Integration with performance logging to update adjustment confidence
- Association creation workflows that prompt for initial key adjustment testing
- Venue-specific song management with key adjustment status visibility
- Export/import handling of key adjustment status and confidence data

#### Research Methodology
**Data Analysis:**
- Review existing key adjustment data patterns and usage
- Analyze user behavior around key adjustment discovery and updates
- Identify common scenarios where adjustment status ambiguity causes problems
- Evaluate frequency of key adjustment changes and confirmation patterns

**Technical Evaluation:**
- Prototype different data model approaches with sample data
- Evaluate query performance and complexity for each approach
- Test database migration strategies with realistic data volumes
- Analyze performance impact of additional metadata and status tracking

**UX Design Research:**
- Design mockups for key adjustment status indication and management
- Plan user interaction patterns for status confirmation and updates
- Research industry best practices for confidence/status indication in similar apps
- Evaluate accessibility and usability of proposed status management workflows

#### Proposed Solutions for Evaluation
**Option A: Nullable Key Adjustment with Confirmation Flag**
```sql
-- Add confirmation status to song_venue_info table
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
-- NULL key_adjustment = unknown, 0 with confirmed=true = confirmed zero
```

**Option B: Key Adjustment Status Enum**
```sql
-- Add status enum field
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_status TEXT CHECK (key_adjustment_status IN ('UNKNOWN', 'DISCOVERED', 'CONFIRMED', 'NEEDS_REVISION'));
```

**Option C: Confidence-Based Approach**
```sql
-- Add confidence level and last updated tracking
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_confidence INTEGER DEFAULT 0; -- 0-100 scale
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_updated_at TIMESTAMP;
```

#### Expected Research Outcomes
**Data Model Recommendation:**
- Preferred approach for distinguishing unknown vs confirmed key adjustments
- Database schema changes and migration strategy
- Performance and maintainability considerations
- Backward compatibility plan for existing data

**User Experience Design:**
- UI patterns for displaying key adjustment status
- User workflows for key adjustment confirmation
- Integration points with performance logging and song management
- Accessibility and usability considerations

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Phased rollout plan for new key adjustment data model
- Testing strategy for data migration and new functionality
- User education and change management approach
- Success metrics for measuring improvement in key adjustment reliability

#### Success Criteria
**Research Completeness:**
- Clear recommendation for data model approach with justification
- Comprehensive migration plan preserving existing user data
- Detailed UI/UX specifications for key adjustment status management
- Technical implementation plan with effort estimates

**User Value Validation:**
- User workflow improvements clearly defined and validated
- Pain points in current system identified and addressed
- Clear value proposition for additional complexity
- User testing plan for proposed solution validation

#### Next Steps
[Research and planning phase - no implementation until design is approved]
