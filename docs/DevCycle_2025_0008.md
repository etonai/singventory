## Phase Overview

### Phase 1 - Comprehensive Testing of Build 0.0.5
**Status:** ‚ùå TODO  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Build Version:** 0.0.5  
**Description:** Comprehensive testing of build 0.0.5 which includes all bug fixes and improvements from DevCycle 2025-0007 phases 2-12

### Phase 2 - Implement Unknown Key Adjustment Default in Venue Screens  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High  
**Build Version:** 0.0.5  
**Description:** Change the default key adjustment display from "0" to "Unknown" in venue-specific song screens. When user clicks +/- buttons, first transition to 0, then adjust. This distinguishes between "never set" (Unknown) vs "intentionally set to zero adjustment" (0)

**Problem Analysis:**
- Current system shows "0" as default key adjustment in venue screens
- Cannot distinguish between songs where user intentionally chose 0 vs never set adjustment
- Creates ambiguity in user workflow and data interpretation
- Songs screen already handles this correctly with default option vs explicit key selection

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
1. **SongVenueInfo Entity Changes:**
   - Consider adding nullable field to distinguish unset vs zero states
   - Or use special sentinel value (-999) to represent "Unknown" state
   - Update database migration if needed

2. **UI Display Logic:**
   - Show "Unknown" instead of "0" when key adjustment is in unset state
   - Update EditSongDetailsFragment (venue version) display logic
   - Ensure consistent styling between "Unknown" and numeric values

3. **Button Interaction Logic:**
   - Modify +/- button handlers to detect "Unknown" state
   - First click (either + or -) transitions Unknown ‚Üí 0, subsequent clicks adjust normally from 0
   - Update increment/decrement logic in venue song editing screens

4. **Data Migration Considerations:**
   - Handle existing records with 0 values (assume Unknown for migration)
   - Ensure import/export maintains Unknown vs 0 distinction
   - Test backward compatibility

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ New venue song associations show "Unknown" by default
- ‚úÖ First +/- click (either button) changes Unknown ‚Üí 0, subsequent clicks adjust normally from 0  
- ‚úÖ Clear visual distinction between Unknown and 0 states
- ‚úÖ Existing data migrated appropriately via Settings migration helper

### Phase 2 - Research Key Adjustment Data Model: Unknown vs Zero Adjustment
**Status:** ‚ùå TODO  
**Priority:** High  
**Build Version:** 0.0.5  
**Description:** Research and planning phase to design data model solution for distinguishing between songs with confirmed zero key adjustment versus songs with unknown/unset key adjustment status

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 2 Key Adjustment Data Research and Planning:**
- ‚ùå TODO: Analyze current key adjustment data model and database schema
- ‚ùå TODO: Research user workflows for key adjustment discovery and confirmation
- ‚ùå TODO: Design data model to distinguish unknown vs confirmed zero adjustments
- ‚ùå TODO: Plan UI/UX patterns for key adjustment status indication and management
- ‚ùå TODO: Evaluate database migration strategy for existing key adjustment data
- ‚ùå TODO: Research best practices for nullable vs status enum approaches
- ‚ùå TODO: Design user interaction patterns for key adjustment confirmation workflows

#### Problem Analysis
**Current Data Ambiguity:**
Currently, a song-venue key adjustment of `0` could mean two fundamentally different things:
1. **Confirmed Zero Adjustment**: User has determined that no key change is needed (song works perfectly in original key at this venue)
2. **Unknown Adjustment**: User hasn't yet determined what key adjustment (if any) is needed for this song at this venue

**Business Impact:**
- **User Confusion**: Cannot distinguish between "tested and confirmed no adjustment needed" vs "haven't figured out the adjustment yet"
- **Data Reliability**: Key adjustment recommendations become unreliable without confidence indicators
- **User Experience**: Users may re-test songs they've already confirmed work in original key
- **Performance Tracking**: Cannot track which songs still need key adjustment discovery vs confirmed settings

#### Research Areas
**Data Model Options:**
1. **Nullable Key Adjustment**: Allow NULL values to indicate unknown, 0 for confirmed zero adjustment
2. **Status Enum Approach**: Add key adjustment status field (UNKNOWN, CONFIRMED, NEEDS_TESTING)
3. **Confidence Level**: Numeric confidence indicator for key adjustment accuracy
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Track when key adjustment was last confirmed or updated
5. **User Intent Flags**: Separate flags for "user has tested" vs "user confirmed setting"

**User Workflow Analysis:**
- **Initial Association**: Song first associated with venue (unknown key adjustment)
- **First Performance**: User discovers key adjustment needed during performance
- **Confirmation**: User confirms key adjustment works well through repeated performances
- **Revision**: User updates key adjustment based on new information or preferences
- **Venue Variability**: Different venues may require different adjustments for same song

**UI/UX Design Considerations:**
- **Visual Indicators**: How to show unknown vs confirmed key adjustments in lists
- **Confirmation Workflows**: User actions to confirm key adjustment accuracy
- **Discovery Assistance**: Help users identify when key adjustments are needed
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient ways to manage key adjustment status for many songs
- **Performance Integration**: How to update confidence during performance logging

#### Technical Research Areas
**Database Schema Analysis:**
- Review current SongVenueInfo table structure and key adjustment field
- Analyze impact of schema changes on existing data and foreign key relationships
- Research database migration strategies for adding status/confidence fields
- Evaluate performance implications of additional fields and queries

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Option A**: Nullable key adjustment with confirmation boolean flag
- **Option B**: Key adjustment status enum with descriptive states
- **Option C**: Confidence-based system with numeric reliability scores
- **Option D**: Timestamp-based approach tracking last confirmation date

**Implementation Complexity:**
- Database migration requirements and data preservation strategies
- UI changes needed across song management, venue management, and performance logging
- Query optimization for filtering by adjustment confidence/status
- Impact on existing import/export functionality and data consistency

#### User Experience Research
**Current Pain Points:**
- Users cannot distinguish between untested and confirmed zero adjustments

**UX Design Research:**
- Design mockups for key adjustment status indication and management
- Plan user interaction patterns for status confirmation and updates
- Research industry best practices for confidence/status indication in similar apps
- Evaluate accessibility and usability of proposed status management workflows

#### Proposed Solutions for Evaluation
**Option A: Nullable Key Adjustment with Confirmation Flag**
```sql
-- Add confirmation status to song_venue_info table
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
-- NULL key_adjustment = unknown, 0 with confirmed=true = confirmed zero
```

**Option B: Key Adjustment Status Enum**
```sql
-- Add status enum field
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_status TEXT CHECK (key_adjustment_status IN ('UNKNOWN', 'DISCOVERED', 'CONFIRMED', 'NEEDS_REVISION'));
```

**Option C: Confidence-Based Approach**
```sql
-- Add confidence level and last updated tracking
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_confidence INTEGER DEFAULT 0; -- 0-100 scale
ALTER TABLE song_venue_info ADD COLUMN key_adjustment_updated_at TIMESTAMP;
```

### Phase 9 - Remove Duplicate Title from Associate Venues with Song Page
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** Low  
**Build Version:** 0.0.5  
**Description:** Remove the redundant second title bar from the Associate Venues with Song page that duplicates the main navigation title and back button, creating visual redundancy

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 9 Duplicate Title Removal Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Locate Associate Venues with Song page layout and fragment implementation (fragment_associate_venues_with_song.xml + AssociateVenuesWithSongFragment)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Identify the redundant second title bar with duplicate title and back button (AppBarLayout with MaterialToolbar lines 8-23)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Remove the secondary AppBarLayout/MaterialToolbar from the fragment layout (removed entire app_bar_layout section)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Update layout constraints to connect content directly to parent after title removal (song_info_card now constrains to parent top)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Remove any toolbar setup code from the fragment if it exists (removed setupToolbar() method and call)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Ensure main navigation title remains functional and displays correctly (relies on navigation component title)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Test layout build successfully - no breaking changes (layout rebuilds correctly without toolbar references)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Verify navigation and back button functionality through main navigation (uses Navigation Component back handling)
- ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Build verification successful - no compilation errors (build successful)

#### Problem Analysis
**UI Redundancy Issue:**
The Associate Venues with Song page currently displays two identical title bars - one from the main navigation system and a second redundant title bar within the fragment itself, both showing the same text and back arrow functionality.

**Visual Problems:**
- **Duplicate Titles**: Two identical title bars showing the same information
- **Redundant Back Buttons**: Two back arrows performing the same navigation action
- **Visual Clutter**: Unnecessary UI elements reducing available content space
- **Unprofessional Appearance**: Duplicate elements create unpolished, buggy appearance

#### Technical Investigation Areas
**Fragment Layout Analysis:**
- Review AssociateVenuesWithSongFragment layout file structure
- Locate secondary AppBarLayout or MaterialToolbar causing duplication
- Check fragment initialization code for toolbar setup methods
- Identify content constraints that depend on secondary toolbar

**Navigation Integration:**
- Verify main navigation title display from nav_graph.xml configuration

### Phase 12 - Set Default Sort to Title in Songs Page
**Status:** ‚ùå TODO  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Build Version:** 0.0.5  
**Description:** Change the default sort order in the Songs page to sort by song title alphabetically, providing users with a more intuitive and organized song list experience

#### Phase Progress
**Phase 12 Songs Default Sort Implementation:**
- ‚ùå TODO: Locate Songs fragment and current sorting implementation
- ‚ùå TODO: Identify current default sort order in SongsFragment or SongsViewModel
- ‚ùå TODO: Update default sort order to sort by song title alphabetically
- ‚ùå TODO: Ensure sort order persists across app sessions if using saved preferences

- Title-based sorting aligns with user mental models from other music applications
- Alphabetical ordering improves accessibility and navigation efficiency

**Scalability Consideration:**
- As users add more songs, alphabetical sorting becomes increasingly important
- Non-alphabetical defaults become less usable as collections grow
- Title sorting provides consistent, predictable song organization
- Better supports users with large song catalogs

#### Expected Changes
**Default Sort Implementation:**
- Update Songs fragment or ViewModel to use title-based sorting as default
- Modify database query to include `ORDER BY title COLLATE NOCASE` or similar
- Ensure case-insensitive alphabetical ordering for consistent results
- Maintain existing sort option functionality for user customization

**Query Modification Example:**
```kotlin
// Before: Default sort (possibly by ID or date added)
@Query("SELECT * FROM songs")
fun getAllSongs(): Flow<List<Song>>

// After: Default alphabetical sort by title
@Query("SELECT * FROM songs ORDER BY title COLLATE NOCASE ASC")
fun getAllSongs(): Flow<List<Song>>
```

#### Implementation Plan
**File Modifications:**
1. **Song DAO**: Update default query to sort by title alphabetically
2. **SongsFragment/ViewModel**: Ensure default sort initialization uses title ordering
3. **Sort Options**: Verify sort menu still allows user to change sort order
