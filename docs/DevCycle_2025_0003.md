# Development Cycle 2025-0003

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Target Completion:** TBD  
**Focus:** Core UI layer implementation with essential screens and navigation for Singventory user scenarios

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on implementing the foundational UI layer that enables users to interact with the robust database architecture completed in DevCycle 2. The goal is to create the essential screens and workflows that support the three key user scenarios identified in `docs/Initial_Singventory_Design.md`: impromptu visits, recon visits, and repeat visits. Following PlayStreak's proven MVVM + ViewBinding patterns, this cycle will establish the core navigation and CRUD functionality needed for a functional karaoke tracking app.

## Current Work Items

### Phase 1 - Main Activity and Navigation Setup
**Status:** üìã Open  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Implement MainActivity with bottom navigation and fragment management following PlayStreak's navigation architecture

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Navigation:**
- ‚ùå TODO: Create MainActivity with bottom navigation (4 tabs: Songs, Venues, Visits, Settings)
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement Navigation Component setup following PlayStreak patterns
- ‚ùå TODO: Create base fragments for each main tab
- ‚ùå TODO: Add Material Design 3 theming with music-themed adaptations
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement fragment lifecycle management and state preservation

#### Technical Implementation Details
**Navigation Architecture (Based on PlayStreak and Initial_Singventory_Design.md):**
- **Bottom Navigation Tabs**: Songs (inventory), Venues (locations), Visits (session logging), Settings (config/data management)
- **Fragment Management**: ViewBinding-based fragments with proper lifecycle handling
- **Deep Linking**: Support for navigation between related screens
- **Theme Integration**: Material Design 3 with music-specific iconography and PlayStreak's color scheme

#### Next Steps
- Set up MainActivity as foundation for all user interactions
- Implement bottom navigation matching design requirements
- Create fragment structure that supports offline-first usage

### Phase 2 - Songs and Venues CRUD Screens
**Status:** üìã Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement core CRUD functionality for songs and venues with search/filter capabilities

#### Phase Progress
**Phase CRUD Implementation:**
- ‚ùå TODO: Create SongsFragment with RecyclerView following PlayStreak's list patterns
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement AddSongFragment with form validation and key input support
- ‚ùå TODO: Create VenuesFragment with venue list and search functionality
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement AddVenueFragment with venue information input
- ‚ùå TODO: Add floating action buttons for quick addition workflow
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement search functionality prioritizing frequently performed songs
- ‚ùå TODO: Create song-venue association screens for adding venues to existing songs

#### Technical Implementation Details
*To be documented as CRUD screens are implemented*

#### Next Steps
- Build core content management screens
- Implement search and filtering as specified in design document
- Support dual key input methods for musical key management

### Phase 3 - Visit Management and Performance Logging
**Status:** üìã Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement visit creation, performance logging, and key adjustment workflows for live karaoke scenarios

#### Phase Progress
**Phase Visit Workflows:**
- ‚ùå TODO: Create VisitsFragment showing recent and active visits
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement StartVisitFragment with venue selection and auto-complete
- ‚ùå TODO: Create ActiveVisitFragment for live performance logging during karaoke sessions
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement quick performance entry with minimal tap requirements
- ‚ùå TODO: Add key adjustment interface supporting both dropdown and step-based input
- ‚ùå TODO: Create visit completion workflow with explicit end/reopen capability
- ‚ùå TODO: Implement performance notes entry (optional immediate, can add later)

#### Technical Implementation Details
*To be documented as visit management features are implemented*

#### Next Steps
- Focus on speed of performance logging for live use
- Support all three user scenarios from design document
- Integrate musical key management system from DevCycle 2

## Cycle Notes
- Building on complete database architecture from DevCycle 2
- Following PlayStreak's proven UI patterns and fragment management
- Implementing offline-first design for poor connectivity at karaoke venues
- Supporting all user scenarios from Initial_Singventory_Design.md
- Material Design 3 with music-themed adaptations as specified in design

## Future Cycles
- Settings screen with data counters (following PlayStreak patterns)
- Import/Export functionality (direct copy from PlayStreak)
- Purge data functionality with stats preservation
- Advanced features like analytics and search enhancements

## Cycle Completion Summary
*[To be added when cycle is completed]*

## Design Document Reference
This implementation directly supports the user scenarios outlined in `docs/Initial_Singventory_Design.md`:

**Impromptu Visit Scenario (Lines 82-94):**
- Quick venue creation with minimal required information
- Song-venue association through "add venue" icon workflow
- Performance logging with optional notes ("too high", "too low", "just right")
- Rapid workflow for friends and social karaoke situations

**Recon Visit Scenario (Lines 95-110):**
- Pre-visit venue setup with full information entry
- Song candidate addition before visiting venue
- Venue song ID entry for preparation
- Post-visit key information and preference updates

**Repeat Visit Scenario (Lines 111-122):**
- Quick venue selection for known locations
- Display of researched songs with key information and frequency indicators
- Performance entry showing venue song IDs and key adjustments
- Visit completion with notes about cost, duration, companions

**Key Requirements from Design Document:**
- Bottom navigation: Songs, Venues, Visits, Settings (PlayStreak pattern)
- Quick performance logging optimized for live karaoke use
- Dual key input methods: dropdown selection AND step adjustments
- Search prioritizing frequently performed songs
- Offline-first operation for venues with poor connectivity
- Visit auto-save after each performance entry
- Explicit visit end/reopen capability
